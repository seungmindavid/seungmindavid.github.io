I am a M.S. candidate in Computer Science at Vanderbilt University, having previously earned a Bachelors's degree in Computer Science from Indiana University - Bloomington. A quote “Stay thirsty for knowledge” serves as a guiding principle for me, and it propels for me to stay formed about the latest development in the field of AI. With a profound motivation to delve into the realm of AI, I am eager to utilize my skill sets to contribute innovative projects.

Throughout my academic journey, I have acquired a comprehensive understanding of Machine Learning, spanning theoretical aspects to practical development. My coursework and hands-on projects have involved the training and fine-tuning of models in large-scale environments, with emphasis on areas such as image generation and recommendation systems. For a detailed overview of my projects, please refer to the Portfolio section.


Work Experience
======

Data Analyst / Backend Engineer
- Work Period

Online financial transaction have become an essential part of our lives. While such online transactions are initially convenient, the type and scope of damage have also increased exponentially. In my role as an Associate Data Analyst within the Risk Management team, my primary focus has been on establishment of a robust Fraud Detection System (FDS). This involves leveraging SQL procedures to proactively tackle recurring fraud instances. Furthermore, I enhanced the algorithm used to assess customers’ creditworthiness within a mobile payment service through analysis of payment rates, transaction history, and the incorporation of data from mobile operators to significantly enhance accuracy. 

In my concurrent role as a Backend Engineer for secure online payment services, I constructed a web server dedicated to the UnionPay payment service within the PAYCOIN application. Additionally, I developed APIs using Flask to seamlessly execute stored procedures in the database, thereby ensuring the utmost security in UnionPay transactions. My expertise extends to the architecting of database schemas for emerging payment services, such as LGPAY and account transfer services.
