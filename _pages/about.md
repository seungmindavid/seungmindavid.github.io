About Me:
------

I am a M.S. candidate in Computer Science at Vanderbilt University, having previously earned a Bachelors's degree in Computer Science from Indiana University - Bloomington. My professional experience includes a contribution to data analytics and financial risk management at DANAL, a Fintech company. During my tenure, I implemented a robust Fraud Detection System (FDS) and improved the credit identification process for an online payment service.

Throughout my academic journey, I have acquired a comprehensive understanding of Machine Learning, spanning theoretical aspects to practical development. My coursework and hands-on projects have involved the training and fine-tuning of models in large-scale environments, with emphasis on areas such as image generation and recommendation systems.

A quote "Stay thirsty for knowledge" serves as a guiding principle for me, and it propels me to stay formed about the latest development in the field of AI. This dedication instills confidence in my ability to perform qualitative work. For a detailed overview of my projects, please refer to the Portfolio section.
