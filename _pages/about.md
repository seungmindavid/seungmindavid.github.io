I am a M.S. candidate in Computer Science at Vanderbilt University, having previously earned a Bachelors's degree in Computer Science from Indiana University - Bloomington. A quote “Stay thirsty for knowledge” serves as a guiding principle for me, and it propels for me to stay formed about the latest development in the field of AI. With a profound motivation to delve into the realm of AI, I am eager to utilize my skill sets to contribute innovative projects.

Throughout my academic journey, I have acquired a comprehensive understanding of Machine Learning, spanning theoretical aspects to practical development. My coursework and hands-on projects have involved the training and fine-tuning of models in large-scale environments, with emphasis on areas such as Large Language Model(LLM), Image Generation and Recommendation Systems. For a detailed overview of my projects, please refer to the [Repository](https://seungmindavid.github.io/repository/) section.
