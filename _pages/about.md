I am a M.S. in Computer Science at Vanderbilt University, following the completion of my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from Indiana University - Bloomington.

Throughout my academic journey, I have acquired a robust understanding of Artificial Intelligence (AI), encompassing both its theoretical aspects to practical development. Leveraging my educational background, I have actively sought to deepen my expertise and disseminate knowledge in AI. I have curated resources covering fundamental concepts in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Representational Learning.

Guided by the principle, “Stay thirsty for knowledge”, I am committed to staying informed about the latest advancements in AI. My keen interest in this area motivates me to contribute to innovative projects involving Large Language Models (LLM) and Generative Models. My current research interests include exploring Score-based Diffusion Models and Continual Learning.
