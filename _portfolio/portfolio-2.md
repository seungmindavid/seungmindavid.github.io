[Examination of Linear Algebra] (https://github.com/seungmindavid/Linear-Algebra)

Proficiency in machine learning algorithms necessitates a profound understanding of foundational mathematical disciplines, specifically linear algebra, calculus, and probability theory.

Within this repository, a comprehensive exploration of machine learning algorithms will be undertaken, focusing on three principal facets aligned with the aforementioned mathematical domains.

Algorithms covered:
1. Linear & Polynomial Regression 
2. Logistic Regression
3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
4. Locality Sensitive Hashing - Random projection
5. K Nearest Neighbors (Classifiers & Regressor)
6. Dimensionality Reduction (PCA, LDA, Auto-Encoder, CCA)
7. Clustering (K-Means Clustering)
8. Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), Expectation Maximization (EM) Algorithms
9. Spectral Clustering
10. Generative Modeling (GAN)
11. Diffusion Model
12. Deep Learning
13. Reinforcement Learning
